.
├── build                        # This folder is generated after running the build command and contains compiled files, object files, and executable binaries. Typically, you won’t need to edit files here, as they are auto-generated by the build system.
├── CMakeLists.txt               # The main CMake configuration file for the entire project. It includes settings and configurations for building each component and the main application.
├── components                   # This folder holds modular components of the project, each with its own code, configuration, and dependencies.
│     ├── component1
│     │     ├── CMakeLists.txt   # CMake configuration file specific to 'component1.' It lists source files, libraries, and dependencies for building this component.
│     │     ├── Kconfig          # Configuration options for 'component1.' This file defines user-selectable settings that integrate with the ESP-IDF menuconfig system, allowing customization of component behavior.
│     │     └── src1.c           # Source code for 'component1,' containing the logic and functionality specific to this module.
│     └── component2
│         ├── CMakeLists.txt     # CMake configuration for 'component2,' defining its build instructions and dependencies.
│         ├── include
│         │     └── component2.h # Header file for 'component2,' containing declarations for functions, macros, and structures accessible from other parts of the project.
│         ├── Kconfig            # Configuration options for 'component2,' enabling settings for menuconfig integration.
│         └── src2.c             # Source code for 'component2,' implementing its core functionality.
├── documentation                # This folder is designated for project documentation. It may contain guides, technical specs, or API documentation to assist users in understanding and using the project.
├── main                         # This folder holds the main application code, serving as the entry point for the project.
│     ├── CMakeLists.txt         # CMake configuration for the main application code, defining source files and dependencies for the core functionality.
│     ├── src1.c                 # Main application source file 1, typically containing setup or initialization code.
│     └── src2.c                 # Main application source file 2, potentially containing additional logic for the primary application.
├── README.md                    # Overview of the project, including setup instructions, features, and usage information. It's often the first reference for new users.
├── sdkconfig                    # A configuration file generated by ESP-IDF’s menuconfig tool, containing project-specific settings like pin configurations and component options.
